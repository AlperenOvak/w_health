# W-Health
![Alt text](README_assets/logo.jpeg)
## Project Overview

W-Health is a comprehensive healthcare app designed to empower women in navigating their healthcare journey. Our solution includes features like a supportive forum for sharing experiences, an intelligent AI assistant providing personalized health guidance, a convenient doctor-finding tool, and an educational hub offering comprehensive health information. The goal is to foster a community-driven approach to women's health and well-being, breaking down barriers and promoting gender equality in healthcare.

## Problem Statement

W-Health addresses significant barriers obstructing women's access to essential healthcare information and services. Limited access, stigma, and taboos surrounding women's health topics hinder informed decision-making and timely medical assistance, perpetuating disparities in health outcomes. The app aims to empower women by providing knowledge, support, and access to healthcare professionals, with a specific focus on young girls who face additional challenges due to a lack of health education.

## Sustainable Development Goals

Our project aligns with United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 5: Gender Equality, focusing on targets 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 for women's decision-making autonomy in healthcare and equal access to sexual and reproductive health services. Additionally, we contribute to Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being, targeting 3.1.1 and 3.3.1 to reduce maternal mortality and end the AIDS epidemic.

## User Testing

We conducted user testing with diverse groups, receiving feedback on the forum, AI assistant, and doctor-finding features. Improvements were made in forum organization, AI guidance clarity, and doctor profile richness based on user suggestions.


## Project Impact

Our app transforms women's healthcare experiences by providing a supportive community, personalized guidance, access to healthcare providers, and medication tracking. User feedback and testing demonstrated the effectiveness of our solution in addressing healthcare disparities.

## Future Steps

We plan to enhance the medication tracking feature, integrate period cycle monitoring, and explore smartwatch compatibility. Partnerships with healthcare providers and community organizations will be pursued to expand our reach and impact.

## Scaling Considerations

The chosen technical architecture, including Flutter, Firebase, Gemini, and Google Maps API, provides a solid foundation for scalability. Minor adjustments and regular optimizations will be implemented to support a growing user base.
